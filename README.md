**Abstract:** Across marine protected area (MPA) networks, a variety of design criteria may influence the efficacy of this form of spatial management to enhance biodiversity conservation and provide fisheries benefits. Meta-analyses have evaluated the influence of reserve attributes on abundance, biomass, and size structure of harvested species, reporting that MPA size, age, depth, and connectivity influence effectiveness. However, few empirical MPA evaluation studies use consistent sampling methodology across multiple reserves and years. Our study employed a community-based science program with recreational anglers to conduct standardized sampling across the largest scientifically-designed network of MPAs in the world, allowing us to examine the factors driving MPA efficacy. Our results indicate size, age, geography, and fishing pressure are important factors contributing to increased fish biomass inside MPAs. Our study provides critical insight for the design and adaptive management of reserve networks spanning large geographic scales and the value of collaborative research with diverse stakeholders.
